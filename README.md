# DPFree - Synthetic Data Generation for Pandemic Response

## Overview
DPFree is an innovative project designed to address the critical challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, where over 531,000 lives were lost. The inaccessibility of real-time COVID-19 data—due to privacy concerns, logistical inefficiencies, and a lack of manual workforce—hindered timely, data-driven decisions that could have saved lives. DPFree leverages cutting-edge Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data that is both realistic and privacy-preserving, enabling better decision-making in pandemic scenarios.

## Impact and Lives Saved
The absence of accessible, real-time data during the COVID-19 pandemic in India had catastrophic consequences. DPFree aims to bridge this data gap by providing synthetic data that mirrors real-world scenarios while safeguarding privacy. By making accurate and usable data available promptly, DPFree empowers healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers to make informed decisions, leading to better resource allocation, more effective containment strategies, and ultimately, lives saved in future pandemics.
